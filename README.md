This repository contains the code developed for the Smart Greenhouse System, a part of my bachelor's thesis at VSB-TUO.

The system focuses on monitoring and controlling greenhouse conditions using distributed sensor units and environmental systems, connected via MQTT protocol and managed through a Django-based server application.
